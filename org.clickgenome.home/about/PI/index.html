                <p>What a great loss!</p>
                <p>Adi F. Gazdar, MD passed away at 12/29/2018</p>
                <p>Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA</p>
                <p>Adi Gazdar was born in India, went to Medical School at the University of London (Guys Hospital), did his residency at the Brigham in Boston and then worked at the National Cancer institute Bethesda, MD as a senior scientist/Section head for 23 years. In 1991 he joined his long-time colleague John Minna at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX where he served at the Simmons Cancer Center and Department of Pathology as the W. Ray Wallace Distinguished Chair in Molecular Oncology Research. He was known primarily for the following:</p>
                <p>1) Elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of cancers, primarily lung cancer, both NSCLC and SCLC. His many discoveries and interests included studying the demographics of EGFR mutations, PIK3CA mutations and copy number changes in human cancers, lung cancer in never smokers and the neuroendocrine properties and heterogeneity of SCLC.</p>
                <p>2) Establishment and characterization of over 400 human tumor cell lines, perhaps more than anyone else. The focus had been on lung cancer of all types, but include breast, colon, ovary and T cell lymphomas etc. These have been distributed to many 100s of researchers worldwide and over 18,000 citations have utilized the lines.  </p>
                <p>3) During his long career, Adi Gazdar had published about 800 articles, book chapters, commentaries etc., and been cited over 110,000 times, ranking him among the top 1% of active scientists in the biomedical field. He had been a long standing and enthusiastic supporter of cancer research and scientific collaboration. </p>
                <p>Dr. Gazdar imitated the idea of this website and supported it as much as he could. He and Dr. Song created Mountain plot and Deflection plot, the two powerful victualing tools for genomic copy number variations. </p>
